There has been a lot of coverage of [NSA mass surveillance](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files) and the [public/private surveillance partnership](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/08/the_publicpriva_1.html) since Edward Snowden released his [documents](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/nsadocs "searchable snowden documents").
 I want to talk about how this data is being accessed, added to and used on the ground today, by the sad, compromised people that think it's OK to inform on and operate against their neighbors and coworkers.
